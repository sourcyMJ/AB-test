# A/B test

### Task:

Data science team developed new algorithms that, they think, will increase CTR metric. There is a need to provide statistically proved analysis that will test proposed hypothesis. Basing on results of this analysis it is required to provide recommendations for further implementation of new algorithm for some social network.

### Project description:

To perform A/A for one proposed algorithm and A/B test for another algorithm. 


### Stack:

Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, gradient boosting (lightgbm)
